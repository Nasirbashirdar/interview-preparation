Question:
3.25 liters are drawn from a container full of milk and is then filled with water. This operation is performed two more times. The ratio of the quantity of milk now left in the container to that of water is 8:19. How much milk did the container hold originally?

Solution:
Let the initial volume of the container be x liters.
After three replacements of 3.25 liters each, the remaining milk follows the formula:

Question 18 of 30:
Question:
The transportation cost of sugar is 20% of its cost price. The price of sugar is increased by 10%, and the transportation cost by 20%. The consumption is reduced by x% so that the expenses remain unchanged. What is the value of x?

Solution:
Let the original cost price of sugar be ‚Çπ100.

Initial transportation cost = 20% of 100 = ‚Çπ20, so total cost = ‚Çπ120.
After a 10% price increase, new cost = ‚Çπ110.
After a 20% increase in transportation cost, new transport = ‚Çπ24, so total new cost = ‚Çπ134.
To maintain the same expenditure, the percentage reduction in consumption is calculated as:

Question 21 of 30:
Question:
A 600g fruit contains 40% juice in it. After it dries, the weight is reduced to 500g. What is the ratio of juice and pulp in the dried fruit?

Solution:

Juice in the original fruit = 40% of 600g = 240g
Pulp in the original fruit = 600g - 240g = 360g
After drying, the weight is 500g, meaning 100g of water evaporated.
Remaining juice = 240g - 100g = 140g

Question:
A pineapple seller sold 5 pineapples at the cost price of 7. While doing so, what would be the profit percentage achieved by him?

Solution:
If the seller sold 5 pineapples at the cost price of 7, it means he sold each pineapple at 7/5 = ‚Çπ1.40.

If the cost price of each pineapple was ‚Çπ1, then the selling price is ‚Çπ1.40.

 A florist has to make bouquets using red roses and yellow roses, and the ratio of the number of red roses to the number of yellow roses is to be the same in each bouquet. If there are 15 red roses and 85 yellow roses available for the bouquets, what is the maximum number of bouquets that can be made using all the roses available?
‚úÖ Answer: 5 bouquets.
Explanation: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 85 is 5. Hence, 5 bouquets can be made while maintaining the same ratio.
